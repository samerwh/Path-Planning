# Path-Planning

[path-planning.cpp](https://github.com/samerwh/Path-Planning/blob/main/path_planning.cpp) consists of an implementation of the A-Star path search algorithm. The algorithm computes the shortest path that can be taken to move from a known starting position to a known destination. The map and path are plotted using matplotlib.
